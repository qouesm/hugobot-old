# Private Discord bot written in Go with the [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library

This is a Discord bot I'm developing to replace a bot that that's gone AWOL in a server I run while adding some much needed features.

If you are a member of said server and you know or want to learn some Go and want to help, do message me!

## TODO

- make it work (sad xd)
